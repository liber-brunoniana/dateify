The "Brown Daily Herald" first appeared on Wednesday, December 2, 1891.<cite><a href="BDH Brown Daily Herald.html">BDH Brown Daily Herald</a></cite>
The secret planning for the paper was actually begun about a month earlier by Ted Baylies 1895 and George Hunter 1893, who, as readers of the Harvard "Crimson" and the "Yale Daily News" were convinced that they could put out a daily newspaper at Brown.<cite><a href="BDH Brown Daily Herald.html">BDH Brown Daily Herald</a></cite>
They enlisted the help of John 1893 and Edward Casey 1893, who were putting themselves through college in their printing shop at the foot of College Hill.<cite><a href="BDH Brown Daily Herald.html">BDH Brown Daily Herald</a></cite>
Baylies and Steve Hopkins 1893 rounded up advertising for the whole year to insure the financial soundness of their proposed venture.<cite><a href="BDH Brown Daily Herald.html">BDH Brown Daily Herald</a></cite>
Ben Johnson 1893, H. Anthony Dyer 1894, and Guy A. Andrews 1895 were also named to the board of editors.<cite><a href="BDH Brown Daily Herald.html">BDH Brown Daily Herald</a></cite>
The "Herald" received a cool reception from the "<a href="Brunonian.html">Brunonian</a>," which in 1890 had welcomed the "<a href="Brown Magazine.html">Brown Magazine</a>" as a new literary publication and devoted its own pages to news, but had rejected the idea of daily publication.<cite><a href="BDH Brown Daily Herald.html">BDH Brown Daily Herald</a></cite>
Nevertheless, the "Herald" survived and even began to have a social life, holding its first banquet at the Crown Hotel in 1903, and playing the first of a long series of annual baseball games against the "<a href="Brunonian.html">Brunonian</a>" in 1907.<cite><a href="BDH Brown Daily Herald.html">BDH Brown Daily Herald</a></cite>
As a supporter of Charles Evans Hughes 1881 for president in 1916, the "Herald" happily and in large print proclaimed his victory on November 8, before learning that he had actually lost the election.<cite><a href="BDH Brown Daily Herald.html">BDH Brown Daily Herald</a></cite>
The word "Daily" was dropped in May 1917 when publication was limited to three days a week.<cite><a href="BDH Brown Daily Herald.html">BDH Brown Daily Herald</a></cite>
In the fall of 1918 the paper became a semi-weekly.<cite><a href="BDH Brown Daily Herald.html">BDH Brown Daily Herald</a></cite>
On February 1, 1919, daily publication was resumed.<cite><a href="BDH Brown Daily Herald.html">BDH Brown Daily Herald</a></cite>
After the war, the paper turned its attention to other matters, printing a green issue for St. Patrick’s Day in 1920, and on January 20, 1921, an editorial on the immoral behavior of Brown students and their dates, the "social buds," who came to Brown dances and checked their corsets with the hat-check attendant.<cite><a href="BDH Brown Daily Herald.html">BDH Brown Daily Herald</a></cite>
The "Literary Supplement of the Brown Daily Herald," a twelve-page collection of poetry and short pieces of prose, priced at fifteen cents, made two appearances, in April and May of 1921, and then disappeared.<cite><a href="BDH Brown Daily Herald.html">BDH Brown Daily Herald</a></cite>
For some reason, in December 1921, when the "Herald" was celebrating its thirtieth anniversary, the masthead began to include the words, "Founded in 1866, Daily since 1891."<cite><a href="BDH Brown Daily Herald.html">BDH Brown Daily Herald</a></cite>
Perhaps the "Herald," decided to adopt its rival, the "<a href="Brunonian.html">Brunonian</a>," with which it had coexisted, as an antecedent, and to stretch its life back to 1866, when another "<a href="Brunonian.html">Brunonian</a>," this one a rival of the "<a href="Brown Paper.html">Brown Paper</a>," appeared.<cite><a href="BDH Brown Daily Herald.html">BDH Brown Daily Herald</a></cite>
On October 19, 1924, a newspaper appeared with the title, "Brown Daily Drivel," a single issue printed by students as a travesty on the "Brown Daily Herald."<cite><a href="BDH Brown Daily Herald.html">BDH Brown Daily Herald</a></cite>
In 1933 the Herald caused a considerable stir by launching an editorial campaign urging students at Brown and at other colleges to sign petitions pledging "not to bear arms except when the country is invaded."<cite><a href="BDH Brown Daily Herald.html">BDH Brown Daily Herald</a></cite>
When a destructive hurricane struck New England on September 21, 1938, during freshman week, eight upperclassmen who were on campus to greet the freshmen managed to get out by candlelight a mimeographed one-page edition of the "Herald," followed by a similar two-page issue the next day.<cite><a href="BDH Brown Daily Herald.html">BDH Brown Daily Herald</a></cite>
During the second World War the "Brown Daily Herald" again suspended publication on January 12, 1943.<cite><a href="BDH Brown Daily Herald.html">BDH Brown Daily Herald</a></cite>
From March 10 to August 13, 1943 the paper was published weekly and called the "Brown Herald."<cite><a href="BDH Brown Daily Herald.html">BDH Brown Daily Herald</a></cite>
From August 20, 1943 to October 5, 1945 the weekly "Brown Herald-Record" replaced the "Brown Herald" and the "<a href="Pembroke Record.html">Pembroke Record</a>," and during that time had a woman editor, Audrey Mishel ’44.<cite><a href="BDH Brown Daily Herald.html">BDH Brown Daily Herald</a></cite>
In September 1947, when the "Herald" resumed daily publication, it published a magazine called "Midnight," a manual of sorts for the "Herald" staff.<cite><a href="BDH Brown Daily Herald.html">BDH Brown Daily Herald</a></cite>
Its duration is not, however, as long as its numbering suggests, having been inadvertently extended on January 18, 1959, when the volume number abruptly changed from 68 to 88, an error on which all subsequent numbering has been based.<cite><a href="BDH Brown Daily Herald.html">BDH Brown Daily Herald</a></cite>
The "Brown Daily Herald Supplement" was first published on September 28, 1959.<cite><a href="BDH Brown Daily Herald.html">BDH Brown Daily Herald</a></cite>
The "Supplement" continued to be a weekly (although not always on the same day of the week) publication until 1963.<cite><a href="BDH Brown Daily Herald.html">BDH Brown Daily Herald</a></cite>
The "Brown Herald Review," containing literary pieces, art, and book reviews, was published eight times during the academic year from October 1963 until January 1966.<cite><a href="BDH Brown Daily Herald.html">BDH Brown Daily Herald</a></cite>
A hoax issue of the "Herald" which went wrong was that of December 6, 1965, with its oversized headline, "Pembrokers Get Apartments; Experiment Begins in Spring," and related stories.<cite><a href="BDH Brown Daily Herald.html">BDH Brown Daily Herald</a></cite>
On March 27, 1964, a similar effort proclaiming "Pembroke No Longer ‘Coordinate’; <a href="Corporation.html">Corporation</a> Makes Brown ‘Co-ed’" and "Keeney Selects Special Committee to Supervise ‘Herald’" had brought forth no more than a cheerful communication to the managing board from <a href="President.html">President</a> Keeney, probably because of the proximity to April Fool’s Day.<cite><a href="BDH Brown Daily Herald.html">BDH Brown Daily Herald</a></cite>
In 1968 Beverly Hodgson ’70 was acclaimed by the press as "First Woman <a href="Editor.html">Editor</a> of <a href="Ivy League.html">Ivy League</a> Daily" (and coincidentally later married the nephew of Audrey Mishel, the woman editor of the "Herald-Record" of <a href="World War II.html">World War II</a>), and with her managing editor, another woman, Laura Hersh ’70, got the "Herald" out from its new offices at 195 Angell Street.<cite><a href="BDH Brown Daily Herald.html">BDH Brown Daily Herald</a></cite>
In 1973 the Brown Daily Herald Voluntary Publishing Association, which took in outside printing jobs as well as publishing the "Herald," was facing financial difficulties after purchasing typesetting equipment.<cite><a href="BDH Brown Daily Herald.html">BDH Brown Daily Herald</a></cite>
Its first appearance was in the "Brown Daily Herald" of February 15, 1973.<cite><a href="BDH Brown Daily Herald.html">BDH Brown Daily Herald</a></cite>
In February 1975 an editorial staff separate from that of the "Herald" took over the publication of "Fresh Fruit."<cite><a href="BDH Brown Daily Herald.html">BDH Brown Daily Herald</a></cite>
The "Herald," still in debt after a 1974 operating loss of $10,000, began an alumni subscription drive, filed claims against its creditors, and sought incorporation under the laws of Rhode Island.<cite><a href="BDH Brown Daily Herald.html">BDH Brown Daily Herald</a></cite>
With the <a href="Commencement.html">Commencement</a> issue of 1975 the Brown Daily Herald Voluntary Publishing Association became the Brown Daily Herald, Inc.<cite><a href="BDH Brown Daily Herald.html">BDH Brown Daily Herald</a></cite>
In 1985 the "Herald" entered into a contract with the Undergraduate Council of Students, in which the UCS agreed to purchase 5,500 subscriptions at five dollars each for every member of the student body.<cite><a href="BDH Brown Daily Herald.html">BDH Brown Daily Herald</a></cite>
A weekend insert called "good clean fun "" was added in 1986.<cite><a href="BDH Brown Daily Herald.html">BDH Brown Daily Herald</a></cite>
In September 1989 a new supplement, intended to be monthly, appeared under the title, "In Depth."<cite><a href="BDH Brown Daily Herald.html">BDH Brown Daily Herald</a></cite>
On November 2, 1991, the "Brown Daily Herald" held a one-hundredth anniversary celebration, at which William Kovach was the keynote speaker.<cite><a href="BDH Brown Daily Herald.html">BDH Brown Daily Herald</a></cite>
The first such handbook was called "Student’s Hand-Book of Brown University" and was published by the Young Men’s Christian Association in 1888.<cite><a href="Bear Facts.html">Bear Facts</a></cite>
In 1891 additional information was included, such as banks, telegraph offices, and the location of over 200 fire alarm boxes in the city.<cite><a href="Bear Facts.html">Bear Facts</a></cite>
In 1892 Brown University buildings, points of interest in Providence, and a catalogue of the portraits in <a href="Sayles Hall.html">Sayles Hall</a> were added.<cite><a href="Bear Facts.html">Bear Facts</a></cite>
The title was changed to "Hand-book of Brown University" in 1903 and by 1924 to "The <a href="Bear.html">Bear</a> Facts."<cite><a href="Bear Facts.html">Bear Facts</a></cite>
In 1960 "<a href="Bear.html">Bear</a> Facts" was a joint publication of the University Christian Association and the "<a href="Liber Brunensis.html">Liber Brunensis</a>," in 1961 was published for the University Christian Association by <a href="Liber Brunensis.html">Liber Brunensis</a> Publications, and was published by <a href="Liber Brunensis.html">Liber Brunensis</a> Publications from 1962 until 1978, when it was taken over by the Office of the <a href="Dean.html">Dean</a> of Freshmen.<cite><a href="Bear Facts.html">Bear Facts</a></cite>

The Bear, as the mascot of Brown University, had its beginning when Theodore Francis Green 1887, a member of the building committee for Rockefeller Hall, placed the head of a real Brown bear above the arch that was the central feature of the trophy room in time for the opening of the new student union in January 1904.<cite><a href="Bear.html">Bear</a></cite>
The only known earlier attempt to have a mascot had occurred in 1902, when the "Brown Daily Herald" carried this notice on October 24: "Isaac L.

In the fall of 1905 the celebration committee decided to have a mascot for the Brown-Dartmouth football game and appointed W. Douglas Swaffield ’06 to obtain a brown bear and to escort it to Springfield.<cite><a href="Bear.html">Bear</a></cite>

Biology was part of the curriculum during the existence of the early medical school from 1811 to 1827, when undergraduates were admitted to the lectures in anatomy, chemistry, and botany.<cite><a href="Biology.html">Biology</a></cite>
When the medical program ended and its professors departed, <a href="President.html">President</a> Francis Wayland, who had studied medicine, undertook to continue the courses by delivering lectures in natural history in 1828 and in anatomy and physiology in 1829-30.<cite><a href="Biology.html">Biology</a></cite>
Chace, who had been teaching natural philosophy and chemistry, was sent to Philadelphia to attend lectures, and in 1836 was appointed professor of chemistry, physiology, and geology.<cite><a href="Biology.html">Biology</a></cite>
Chace’s physiology course was described in the laws of 1850, "In the course in Physiology it will be the design of the Professor to teach the classifications of the animal and vegetable kingdom, the most important modifications of organized structure, and the laws to which animal and vegetable life is subjected, with special reference to the subjects of health and regimen."<cite><a href="Biology.html">Biology</a></cite>
Chace kept in touch with leading scientists and introduced Agassiz and Gould’s "Principles of Zoology" as a textbook for his course in 1849, the year after its publication.<cite><a href="Biology.html">Biology</a></cite>
After 1850 he offered an advanced course for those "who may desire to pursue the science by the aid of the knife and microscope."<cite><a href="Biology.html">Biology</a></cite>
The physiology course was taught from 1863 to 1865 by Nathaniel P. Hill, who continued to deliver the lectures prepared by Chace.<cite><a href="Biology.html">Biology</a></cite>
In 1865 Dr. Parsons began teaching the course, apparently by some informal arrangement at first, as he was formally appointed "Lecturer in Physiology" only in 1867, when Chace became acting president.<cite><a href="Biology.html">Biology</a></cite>
Not receiving a permanent appointment, Parsons left in 1870, at which time the physiology course was simply added to the duties of the new professor of physics, Eli Whitney Blake.<cite><a href="Biology.html">Biology</a></cite>
In 1875, under <a href="President.html">President</a> Robinson, a separate professorship of physiology was established and Parsons returned to that position.<cite><a href="Biology.html">Biology</a></cite>
The appointments of John Whipple Potter Jenks as professor of agricultural zoology in 1874 in accordance with the requirements of the Morrill Act, of William Whitman Bailey as instructor in botany in 1877, and of Alpheus Spring Packard as professor of zoology and geology in 1878 made it possible for Parsons finally to devote his course to human anatomy and physiology.<cite><a href="Biology.html">Biology</a></cite>
In 1882 Parsons resigned because of his health, and Charles V. Chapin was appointed in his place.<cite><a href="Biology.html">Biology</a></cite>
Chapin’s course at first was taught in the junior year, but in 1885 was shortened to two hours per week and offered to sophomores, whose lack of preparation in chemistry and physics disturbed Chapin, as did the short time allotted.<cite><a href="Biology.html">Biology</a></cite>
When Chapin was ill during the second term of 1884-85, Dr. George Frederic Keene 1875 took over the physiology course.<cite><a href="Biology.html">Biology</a></cite>
In 1889 the course was restored to the junior year, and after Edmund B. Delabarre began to teach psychology in 1892, Chapin was able to drop the teaching of the nervous system.<cite><a href="Biology.html">Biology</a></cite>
He was ill in 1892-93, and after his return the physical culture title was dropped.<cite><a href="Biology.html">Biology</a></cite>
He continued to teach until 1895, but observed that the course, which had been intended as an elementary course in human anatomy and physiology was now elected chiefly by students intending to study medicine, and recommended that "the time has come to drop ‘Physiology,’ in the meaning that it has had in the past from the curriculum, and to strengthen the department of general biology."<cite><a href="Biology.html">Biology</a></cite>
Alpheus Spring Packard joined the department in 1878 and taught electives in zoology and geology.<cite><a href="Biology.html">Biology</a></cite>
In 1882 a laboratory was set up in the basement of <a href="Rhode Island Hall.html">Rhode Island Hall</a>, a place which turned out to be cold and damp and was replaced three years later by a large and well lighted room upstairs in <a href="Rhode Island Hall.html">Rhode Island Hall</a> adjacent to the museum.<cite><a href="Biology.html">Biology</a></cite>

In 1920 <a href="President.html">President</a> Faunce affirmed the University’s decision that buildings should conform to the Colonial or Georgian architecture, "which not only reminds us of the age in which the University was founded, but is far better than the Gothic to give the generous lighting needed in modern libraries and laboratories."<cite><a href="Campus.html">Campus</a></cite>

The "Act for the Establishment of College or University within this Colony" was passed by the House of Magistrates on March 2, 1764, and the Upper House concurred on March 3.<cite><a href="Charter.html">Charter</a></cite>
The act was signed and sealed by the Governor, Samuel Ward, and the Secretary, Edward Thurston, at Newport on October 24, 1765.<cite><a href="Charter.html">Charter</a></cite>

In June 1965 the <a href="Corporation.html">Corporation</a> set about the elimination of the $10,000 exemption by voting that "as a condition of appointment all who are appointed <a href="President.html">President</a> or full Professor effective July 1, 1966 or thereafter shall waive their right to Charter exemption from taxes on their property."<cite><a href="Charter.html">Charter</a></cite>
An attempt in the 1890s to tax real estate in downtown Providence, which was owned and rented for business by the University, was settled by a Supreme Court in 1897 that "the provision of the Charter in question is in full force and operation, and that the tax assessed upon the property ... was wholly illegal and void."<cite><a href="Charter.html">Charter</a></cite>

There was also a feeling that the University was beginning to hoard property, which led <a href="President.html">President</a> Wriston to explain that, despite the 1897 ruling, Brown had adopted a policy of not acquiring property as a real estate investment and of selling donated property not required for future construction at the earliest opportunity.<cite><a href="Charter.html">Charter</a></cite>
In 1909 a committee of nine unanimously recommended that changes should be made, but after referring the matter to the law committee and considering the legal problems, a majority of five supported pursuing changes in the Charter, while the a minority of four recommended waiting.<cite><a href="Charter.html">Charter</a></cite>
In 1915 a second such committee recommended "that no action be taken at the present time."<cite><a href="Charter.html">Charter</a></cite>
A third committee was appointed in 1924, with the result that an amendment to the Charter in 1926 provided that the number of trustees be increased from 36 to 42 and that there be no denominational requirement for the additional trustees.<cite><a href="Charter.html">Charter</a></cite>
Finally, in 1942, the third and latest amendment to the Charter stated that, "no denominational qualification shall be required to make any person eligible to hold the office of Trustee, Fellow, <a href="President.html">President</a>, Professor, Tutor, or other office in Brown University."<cite><a href="Charter.html">Charter</a></cite>

In 1912 a spot on Camp’s first team went to George "Kid" Crowther ’13, nicknamed for his small size, 130 pounds, which did not prevent him from making a dazzling 48-yard run for a touchdown in the Harvard game that year, after the Harvard coach had suggested that the small player should be removed from the game for his own safety.<cite><a href="Football.html">Football</a></cite>
Perhaps the most memorable moment in Brown football history is the 1915 team’s appearance in what is referred to as the first "annual" Rose Bowl game.<cite><a href="Football.html">Football</a></cite>

Brown did not have a really outstanding season in 1915, ending with a 5-3-1 record.<cite><a href="Football.html">Football</a></cite>
The new star who flashed across the field that year was Fritz Pollard ’19, the first black to make Camp’s All-American backfield, but the decisive play was Captain Buzz Andrews’ ’16 first and only field goal of his career, which clinched a 3-0 victory over Yale and the invitation to the Tournament of Roses Association Game (which became known as the Rose Bowl Game in 1923).<cite><a href="Football.html">Football</a></cite>

In 1762, the design of establishing a college was promoted, with the Reverend Morgan Edwards, moderator of the Association a prime mover of the project, and Rhode Island was selected as a likely site, since the colony had been settled by Baptists, was still largely governed by Baptists, and had no college.<cite><a href="Founding.html">Founding</a></cite>
Accordingly, James Manning, a graduate of New Jersey College (Princeton) in 1762, visited Newport in July 1763, where he met with "about 15 gentlemen of the same denomination" at the home of Deputy Governor John Gardner.<cite><a href="Founding.html">Founding</a></cite>

John Whipple Potter Jenks was principal of the academy from 1848 to 1871.<cite><a href="Jenks, John Whipple Potter.html">Jenks, John Whipple Potter</a></cite>
In 1872 John Whipple Potter Jenks came to Brown as curator of the museum, bringing some of his own collections with him.<cite><a href="Jenks, John Whipple Potter.html">Jenks, John Whipple Potter</a></cite>
According to Walter Lee Munro 1879, "What he (Jenks) didn’t know about agriculture would fill a library, but his colleagues knew even less, so, as under the conditions of the land grant for educational purposes from the Federal Government, it was necessary to have a course in agriculture, Professor Jenks was selected to fill the chair."<cite><a href="Jenks, John Whipple Potter.html">Jenks, John Whipple Potter</a></cite>
John Whipple Potter Jenks stayed on the job until his death on September 26, 1894, the particulars of which are described by Walter Lee Munro 1879:<cite><a href="Jenks, John Whipple Potter.html">Jenks, John Whipple Potter</a></cite>
Charles Coffin Jewett (1816-1868), librarian and professor of modern languages, was born in Lebanon, Maine, on August 12, 1816.<cite><a href="Jewett, Charles C..html">Jewett, Charles C.</a></cite>
Charles C. Jewett studied at the Latin School in Salem, Massachusetts, and entered Dartmouth College in 1831.<cite><a href="Jewett, Charles C..html">Jewett, Charles C.</a></cite>
In his sophomore year Charles C. Jewett transferred to Brown, and with other members of the "conscientious class" of 1835, declined to receive his degree in that year, because of the method of distribution of Commencement parts.<cite><a href="Jewett, Charles C..html">Jewett, Charles C.</a></cite>
Charles C. Jewett did accept the degree in 1838.<cite><a href="Jewett, Charles C..html">Jewett, Charles C.</a></cite>
Charles C. Jewett graduated from Andover in 1840, and, intending to be a missionary in the East, was about to embark for foreign study and research, but he missed his ship’s sailing and settled for taking charge of Day’s Academy in Wrentham, Massachusetts, for a year.<cite><a href="Jewett, Charles C..html">Jewett, Charles C.</a></cite>
In 1841 the Joint Library Committee at Brown employed him "to make out a new and improved Catalogue of the University Library, and superintend the printing of the same; and that during the period in which Charles C. Jewett shall be so occupied, he be charged with the ordinary duties of Librarian."<cite><a href="Jewett, Charles C..html">Jewett, Charles C.</a></cite>
The catalogue, when completed in 1843, received favorable notice in the "North American Review" and other publications.<cite><a href="Jewett, Charles C..html">Jewett, Charles C.</a></cite>
Jewett was appointed professor of modern languages and literature, and, in the fall of 1843, was sent to Europe to buy books for the library.<cite><a href="Jewett, Charles C..html">Jewett, Charles C.</a></cite>
Returning in 1845, having bought seven thousand books in French, German, and Italian, and visited the principal libraries of Europe, Charles C. Jewett took up his duties as librarian and professor of modern languages.<cite><a href="Jewett, Charles C..html">Jewett, Charles C.</a></cite>
Jewett’s reputation also won for him appointment as assistant secretary and librarian of the newly founded Smithsonian Institution in 1848.<cite><a href="Jewett, Charles C..html">Jewett, Charles C.</a></cite>
In 1851 the Institution published "Notices of Public Libraries in the United States of America," and Jewett began plans for a compilation of a union catalogue of American libraries and for a method of stereotyped plates (an anticipation of Library of Congress printed cards) for individual titles, from which catalogues of various libraries could be printed.<cite><a href="Jewett, Charles C..html">Jewett, Charles C.</a></cite>
The result of this disagreement was Jewett’s dismissal in July of 1854.<cite><a href="Jewett, Charles C..html">Jewett, Charles C.</a></cite>
At the "Librarian’s Convention" of 1853, Jewett was chosen to preside, and, in opening the proceedings, observed, "We meet for the purpose of seeking mutual instruction and encouragement in the discharge of the quiet and unostentatious labors of our vocation, for which each at his separate post finds perhaps but little sympathy, for which each when at home must derive enthusiasm only from within himself and from the silent masters of his daily communion."<cite><a href="Jewett, Charles C..html">Jewett, Charles C.</a></cite>
True to his vocation, Jewett turned down a college presidency and in 1854 accepted the opportunity to purchase and arrange the books needed for the new Boston Public Library.<cite><a href="Jewett, Charles C..html">Jewett, Charles C.</a></cite>
When the library opened in 1858, Charles C. Jewett was selected as superintendent.<cite><a href="Jewett, Charles C..html">Jewett, Charles C.</a></cite>
Charles C. Jewett's labors were abruptly ended by his sudden death on January 9, 1868 in Braintree, Massachusetts.<cite><a href="Jewett, Charles C..html">Jewett, Charles C.</a></cite>
The <a href="Corporation.html">Corporation</a>, to clear up any doubt of the intention of the charter, voted on September 6, 1770, "That the Children of Jews may be admitted into this Institution and intirely (sic) enjoy the freedom of their own Religion, without any Constraint or Imposition whatever."<cite><a href="Jews.html">Jews</a></cite>
The Laws of 1783 prescribed that a student might not "deny the being of a God, the Existence of Virtue and Vice; or that the Books of the old and new Testament are of divine authority," adding "Young gentlemen of the Hebrew nation are to be excepted from this Law, in so far as it relates to the New Testament and its authenticity."<cite><a href="Jews.html">Jews</a></cite>
Nevertheless, no Jewish student seems to have entered or even applied for over a century, when Israel Strauss of the class of 1894 became Brown’s first known Jewish student.<cite><a href="Jews.html">Jews</a></cite>

The "New York Times," reporting on the incident on April 30, 1929, noted, "The resignations are said to have followed a conference held recently between officials of the University and counsel for the Jewish Fraternity, including Arthur Garfield Hays of New York, at which the university was threatened with prosecution if it persisted in its opposition to the formation of a Jewish Fraternity at Brown."<cite><a href="Jews.html">Jews</a></cite>

With room for 300,000 volumes, the building was expected to last for generations, but by 1930 the demand for space for library operations had become so critical that windows were installed in the first floor coat room to provide work space for the clerical staff and new stacks were installed in the top floor exhibition room.<cite><a href="John Hay Library.html">John Hay Library</a></cite>

On the other hand, when the junior class announced early in 1872 its plan to cremate <a href="Chemistry.html">Chemistry</a> as a change from the usual victims, the professor of chemistry, John Howard Appleton, was upset by this choice, because he feared injury to the reputation of the department and his text-book.<cite><a href="Junior Burials.html">Junior Burials</a></cite>

Medical <a href="Education.html">Education</a> began at Brown in 1811.<cite><a href="Medical education.html">Medical education</a></cite>
The medical instruction which was given from that date until 1827 is often referred to as the "Medical School," but it was, in fact, not a separate school, and was called at the time of its existence the "Medical Department," or, more accurately, the "Medical Lectures in Brown University."<cite><a href="Medical education.html">Medical education</a></cite>

The medical department was not blameless in the state of disruption into which the college has fallen, according to Usher Parsons’ son, Charles W. Parsons, in a paper read before the Rhode Island Historical Society in 1881: As the medical professors depended for their livelihood on their active medical practices, they were unable to comply with the condition of their employment at the college, and the medical school went out of existence.<cite><a href="Medical education.html">Medical education</a></cite>

Phi Beta Kappa admitted the Rhode Island Alpha chapter at Brown University in 1830.<cite><a href="Phi Beta Kappa.html">Phi Beta Kappa</a></cite>
An earlier effort in 1789 to establish a chapter at what was then Rhode Island College was denied by the Massachusetts Alpha at Harvard, because its committee of four tutors and one resident graduate considered the standards of the college so low as to admit "as Sophimores (sic) persons who would not rank as Freshmen at Cambridge."<cite><a href="Phi Beta Kappa.html">Phi Beta Kappa</a></cite>

Alumni College, a program designed to give the alumni a chance to return to the University and attend courses for a week in the summer, was first held in 1962.<cite><a href="University Extension.html">University Extension</a></cite>
It was repeated in 1963 with great success, but was then discontinued apparently because the low fees had caused the University to operate the program at a loss.<cite><a href="University Extension.html">University Extension</a></cite>

The  University Grammar School was a natural outgrowth of the Latin School opened by James Manning in Warren in April 1764.<cite><a href="University Grammar School.html">University Grammar School</a></cite>
In 1770 the school moved to Providence along with the college and was for two years housed in the Brick School House.<cite><a href="University Grammar School.html">University Grammar School</a></cite>
The school and college were related closely enough for grammar school student Billy Edwards, son of Morgan Edwards, one of the founders of the college, to recite a piece from Homer at the close of the <a href="Commencement.html">Commencement</a> exercises in 1770.<cite><a href="University Grammar School.html">University Grammar School</a></cite>

In 1794 the <a href="Corporation.html">Corporation</a> recommended the establishment of a grammar school "as an appendage to this College."<cite><a href="University Grammar School.html">University Grammar School</a></cite>
At some time the school was established and Jeremiah Chaplin 1799, later president of Waterville College, was engaged as master.<cite><a href="University Grammar School.html">University Grammar School</a></cite>
In 1809 the <a href="Corporation.html">Corporation</a> voted that a suitable building be erected for the use of the grammar school and appointed a committee to raise the funds needed "to erect the same on the west line of the <a href="Steward.html">Steward</a>’s garden."<cite><a href="University Grammar School.html">University Grammar School</a></cite>
The cost of the building, erected in 1810, was $1,452.86, which was obtained from 118 persons, with Brown and Ives making up the final amount of $90.30 needed to cover the cost.<cite><a href="University Grammar School.html">University Grammar School</a></cite>
After a succession of schoolmasters, many of whom served for only a year or two, in 1845 Henry S. Frieze 1841 and Merrick Lyon 1841 joined in the operation of the school.<cite><a href="University Grammar School.html">University Grammar School</a></cite>
Under their management the enrollment increased enough that in 1852 they made at their own expense a 35-foot addition to the building.<cite><a href="University Grammar School.html">University Grammar School</a></cite>
When Henry Frieze left for the University of Michigan in 1854, the school was run by Merrick Lyon, who was in charge of the classical department, and his brother, Emory Lyon, who took over the <a href="English.html">English</a> and mathematical department.<cite><a href="University Grammar School.html">University Grammar School</a></cite>
In the 35 years that the Lyon brothers operated the school before the death of Merrick in 1888, 200 of their students went on to study at Brown.<cite><a href="University Grammar School.html">University Grammar School</a></cite>
In 1891 the building provided space for the classes of the first women students.<cite><a href="University Grammar School.html">University Grammar School</a></cite>

University Hall was built in 1770.<cite><a href="University Hall.html">University Hall</a></cite>
The first mention of a college building is found in Hezekiah Smith’s diary in which he reports on September 5, 1765, on the second annual meeting of the <a href="Corporation.html">Corporation</a>, "I was with the <a href="Corporation.html">Corporation</a> at Newport which sat upon the College business, and was elected one of the Fellows of the College.<cite><a href="University Hall.html">University Hall</a></cite>
The latter committee, composed of Stephen Hopkins, Joseph Brown, and John Davis, in a report on September 8, 1769, recommended that "the building do not exceed sixty-six feet long, and thirty-six feet wide, and three stories high; – that it be a plain building, the walls of best bricks and lime, the door and window frames of red cedar; – that there be a cupola for a bell; – that the first building be so situated as to be one wing of the whole College edifice, when completed."<cite><a href="University Hall.html">University Hall</a></cite>
Lawrence C. Wroth, in his unpublished manuscript, "The Construction of the College Edifice, 1770-1772, described the ensuing plans: In 1883 the interior of the building was renovated with the help of the funds left over from the building of <a href="Slater Hall.html">Slater Hall</a>.<cite><a href="University Hall.html">University Hall</a></cite>
The "<a href="Brunonian.html">Brunonian</a> of February 10, 1883 came out against the expenditure of $45,000 for this purpose when "it would be far better to expend this sum in the erection of a new hall than in repairing the present dilapidated structure.<cite><a href="University Hall.html">University Hall</a></cite>
The funds for the project came from $8399.37 left over from the building of <a href="Slater Hall.html">Slater Hall</a> and subscriptions sufficient to bring the total to over $47,000.<cite><a href="University Hall.html">University Hall</a></cite>
In 1884 the Advisory and Executive Committee of the <a href="Corporation.html">Corporation</a> decreed "that tickets be sold to students wishing to use the bathing tubs in the basement of University Hall at the rate of 50 cents for five tickets."<cite><a href="University Hall.html">University Hall</a></cite>

In 1938 an anonymous donor, not a Brown graduate, gave $100,000 toward the fifth major reconstruction of University Hall and a year later added a similar amount.<cite><a href="University Hall.html">University Hall</a></cite>
Architects Perry, Shaw and Hepburn were in charge of the work, which was begun in July 1939.<cite><a href="University Hall.html">University Hall</a></cite>
The exterior walls had been restored in 1905, but now the crumbling foundation was replaced by a new foundation of steel and concrete hidden by materials suitable to the age of the building.<cite><a href="University Hall.html">University Hall</a></cite>
New windows with small panes were installed, as were new chimneys, exact copies made of hand-moulded brick to simulate the chimneys shown in the print of the College Edifice which was produced in the 1790s from a drawing by David Leonard 1792.<cite><a href="University Hall.html">University Hall</a></cite>
The design of the original cupola was a matter of discussion, some being of the opinion that it was hexagonal and Norman Isham 1886, architectural consultant, sure that it was octagonal.<cite><a href="University Hall.html">University Hall</a></cite>
When the modern cupola was removed, remnants of the eight-sided original cupola were revealed, with the names of two former students and their classes, "Amos Hopkins 1792" and "Henry D’Wolfe 1803," carved on one of its uprights.<cite><a href="University Hall.html">University Hall</a></cite>

WBRU was the first college radio station in the country when it began in 1936 as the Brown Network, when George Abraham ’40 and David Borst ’40 strung wires for an inter-dormitory connection to relay the messages and recorded music which Abraham had begun broadcasting to his fellow students on November 30.<cite><a href="WBRU.html">WBRU</a></cite>
After the damage caused to the wiring by the 1938 hurricane, the lines were connected to the dormitory radiators, which served as antennae.<cite><a href="WBRU.html">WBRU</a></cite>
Within a few years twelve more colleges started stations, and in 1940 they formed the Intercollegiate Broadcasting System at an organizational meeting held at Brown on February 18, 1940.<cite><a href="WBRU.html">WBRU</a></cite>
The station identification of the Brown Network was B.U.B.C (for Brown University Broadcasting Company) until 1945, when, upon the prompting of Stephen Plimpton ’48, who hung felt banners with "WBRU" on the microphones, the network elected these call letters.<cite><a href="WBRU.html">WBRU</a></cite>

WBRU joined the Ivy Network in 1952, gaining the advantages of shared advertising and exchange of dramatic programs and sporting events.<cite><a href="WBRU.html">WBRU</a></cite>
WBRU continued to broadcast on closed circuit to the campus community until February 21, 1966, when WBRU-FM, with a new FCC license, reached outside with its first broadcast, a panel show on the Peace Corps.<cite><a href="WBRU.html">WBRU</a></cite>
Required as an FCC-licensed station to carry a certain amount of news coverage, WBRU was fortunate in being named an ABC radio news affiliate in 1968, after the other Providence FM stations declined.<cite><a href="WBRU.html">WBRU</a></cite>
In 1971, after WBRU-FM increased its power to 50,000 watts and moved its transmitting equipment to the roof of the Sciences <a href="Library.html">Library</a>, some interference was created with electronic equipment in the Barus-Holley Building and <a href="Prince Engineering Laboratory.html">Prince Engineering Laboratory</a>, but the most unusual development was that monkeys who had electrodes implanted for reading their brain waves were tuned into WBRU.<cite><a href="WBRU.html">WBRU</a></cite>
In 1976 the station gained attention for its documentary, "Brutality at the Children’s Center," which brought about investigations of the state-run O’Rourke Children’s Center in Providence.<cite><a href="WBRU.html">WBRU</a></cite>
In 1980, when WHJY switched from "beautiful music" to rock/heavy metal, WBRU lost its audience, ratings dropped, and the station was saved from backruptcy in 1981 by a $230,000 Brown-backed bank loan.<cite><a href="WBRU.html">WBRU</a></cite>
